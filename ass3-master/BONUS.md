## 'Do not click' the button in the Lobby Screen!

In lobby screen, after waiting for five seconds, a button will appear and says "DON'T CLICK ME!". Motivated by curiosity, the player will click it. Actually nothing will happen, except for the sentence saying "Nothing happened! I am a boring button!".

This feature may make them less bored while waiting :)
